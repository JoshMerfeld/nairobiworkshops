# Nairobi Workshops

- This repository includes all of the material for Josh Merfeld's presentations at the UN Workshops in October in Nairobi.
  - This material includes my slides (with all of the example code) and all of the data I'll be showing you. Note that I very much suggest the HTML version of slides. The pdf versions are very large and do not have all of the same functionality as the HTML versions.

- You can find the slides in the following locations (note that pdf slides will not have any animations):
  - Day1:
    - [Day 1 slides](https://joshmerfeld.github.io/nairobiworkshops/day1.html)
    - [Day 1 slides in pdf](https://joshmerfeld.github.io/nairobiworkshops/day1.pdf)
    - [Day 1 data](day1data/data)
  - Day1/2 (vector files):
    - [Day 2 slides](https://joshmerfeld.github.io/nairobiworkshops/day2.html)
    - [Day 2 slides in pdf](https://joshmerfeld.github.io/nairobiworkshops/day2.pdf)
    - [Day 2 data](day2data/data)
