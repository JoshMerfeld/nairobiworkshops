## Feature selection

- Let's start with some example data I have
  - This comes from Malawi
    - Northern Malawi only (due to the size of the data)
  - And we'll use it all day tomorrow!<br><br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

library(tidyverse)
surveycollapsed <- read_csv("day3data/ihs5ea.csv")
predictors <- read_csv("day3data/mosaikvars.csv")
```







## A short explanation


- The survey data is collapsed to the admin3 level (TAs)
  - This is the `area`, in SAE terminology
  - I have poverty rates for `areas` (TAs) and `subareas` (EAs)
  - I have some variables that predict poverty at the `subarea` level<br><br>

- So it's a perfect setup for SAE!
  - We want to estimate poverty at the TA
  - We don't have any observations in some TAs and we have too few in others
  - We could estimate a subarea model






## Observations?


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: true
#| fig-align: center


adm4 <- read_sf("day3data/mw4.shp")
adm4 <- adm4 |>
  mutate(EA_CODE = as.numeric(EA_CODE)) |>
  left_join(surveycollapsed, by = "EA_CODE")
adm4$insample <- "No"
adm4$insample[!is.na(adm4$poor)] <- "Yes"
adm3 <- read_sf("day3data/mw3.shp")
surveyTA <- surveycollapsed |>
  mutate(TA_CODE = substr(EA_CODE, 1, 5)) |>
  group_by(TA_CODE) |>
  summarize(poor = weighted.mean(poor, total_weights, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_obs = sum(total_obs, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup()
adm3 <- adm3 |>
  left_join(surveyTA, by = "TA_CODE")
adm3$insample <- "No"
adm3$insample[!is.na(adm3$poor)] <- "Yes"

g1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = adm3, aes(fill = insample), color = "gray", lwd = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer("Have sample\nobservations?", palette = "Spectral") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(subtitle = "A. TA (area) level") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
g2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = adm4, aes(fill = insample), color = "gray", lwd = 0.001) +
  scale_fill_brewer("Have sample\nobservations?", palette = "Spectral") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(subtitle = "B. EA (subarea) level") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
# get the legend
g1legend <- get_legend(g1)

g1new <- plot_grid(g1 + theme(legend.position = "none"), g2, ncol = 2)
plot_grid(g1new, g1legend, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(1, 0.1))

```










## Predictive features

- I also have a bunch of predictive features!
  - The data come from something called MOSAIKS, that we'll discuss briefly tomorrow
  - In short, they are variables derived from satellite imagery
  - Take a look at this

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| class-output: hscroll

predictors

```










## We have a problem

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| class-output: hscroll
# this is how many subarea observations we have
nrow(surveycollapsed)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| class-output: hscroll
# this is how many predictors we have
ncol(predictors)
```

- What's the problem?

. . .

- It's actually impossible to estimate a model with more predictors than observations!









## Another problem: overfitting

- There's another problem, too<br><br>

- If we have too many predictors, we can "overfit" the model
  - This means the model is too complex
  - It fits the data we have *too* well
  - This means it doesn't generalize well to new data<br><br>
  
- So we need to select the best predictors
  - What does "best" mean here?









## Generalizing out-of-sample

- We want to know what best predicts OUT of sample<br><br>

- So we are going to set up our data to allow this:
  - We will split the data into X parts
  - A common number for X is 10, but let's do 5









## Cross validation

## Cross validation

![](day3assets/CVdiagram2.png)


## Cross validation - random folds

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

surveycollapsed$fold <- sample(1:5, nrow(surveycollapsed), replace = TRUE)
head(surveycollapsed)
```

## But what "models" are we going to fit?

- What are the models we are going to fit?
  - We want a way to select the best predictors
  - This will reduce the number of predictors and prevent overfitting (we hope)<br><br>
  
- We are going to use a method called LASSO (or lasso)
  - It's an acronym: **L**east **A**bsolute **S**hrinkage and **S**election **O**perator
  - No details, but it's a way to select the best predictors
    - It "penalizes" the coefficients of the predictors
  - `R` package `glmnet` does this for us











## The setup - with a transformed outcome
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
library(glmnet)
set.seed(398465) # this is a random process, so we want to set the seed!

# we need to set up the data (combining the predictors and the outcome)
data <- surveycollapsed |>
  left_join(predictors, by = "EA_CODE")

# cv.glmnet will set up everything for us
lasso <- cv.glmnet(
  y = asin(sqrt(data$poor)), # the outcome
  x = data |> dplyr::select(starts_with("mosaik")) |> as.matrix(), # the predictors (as.matrix() is required)
  weights = data$total_weights, # the weights (sample weights)
  nfolds = 5) # number of folds (10 is the default)
lasso
```











## What have we done?
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
lasso
```
<br>

- What are the different "models"?
  - Different values of lambda
  - In this case, the "best" lambda is 0.02030
  - Note that some people prefer to use the `1se` value (it is more conservative). No details today.










## Different values of lambda: different predictors!
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
lasso
```
<br>

- At the "optimal" lambda, we have 6 predictors (non-zero coefficients)










## Choosing based on mean-squared error (MSE)
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: true
#| fig.align: center
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = log(lasso$glmnet.fit$lambda), y = log(lasso$cvm))) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "log(lambda)", y = "log(MSE)") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = log(lasso$lambda.min)), linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = log(lasso$lambda.1se)), linetype = "dashed")
```










## Non-zero coefficients
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: true
#| fig.align: center
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = log(lasso$glmnet.fit$lambda), y = lasso$glmnet.fit$df)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "log(lambda)", y = "Non-zero coefficients") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = log(lasso$lambda.min)), linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = log(lasso$lambda.1se)), linetype = "dashed")
```
  










## Non-zero coefficients
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| fig.align: center
coef(lasso, s = "lambda.min")
```










## What we want: the non-zero variable names!

- Getting the names of the variables is more complicated than it should be

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# first, turn the coefs into a data.frame
coefs <- coef(lasso, s = "lambda.min") |>
  as.matrix() |>
  as.data.frame()
coefs
```










## What we want: the non-zero variable names!

- Getting the names of the variables is more complicated than it should be

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Now, create variable that is the name of the rows
coefs$variable <- rownames(coefs)
head(coefs)
# non-zero rows
coefs <- coefs[coefs$s1!=0,]
# finally, the names of the variables
coefs$variable
```
  










## One more step: remove the Intercept!

- We don't want the name of the intercept
  - All of the packages we use will add that automatically
  
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| # remove first value (the intercept)
allvariables <- coefs$variable[-1]
allvariables
```
  










## How do we use this with ebp?

- In EBP, we need a `formula`
- How do we turn this into a formula?
  - We need to add the outcome variable (poor) `and` combine the predictors with `+`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
ebpformula <- as.formula(paste("poor ~", paste(allvariables, collapse = " + ")))
ebpformula
```











## Finally: estimating the model

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
library(povmap) # I like to use povmap instead of emdi (personal preference)
# get "area" variable
predictors$TA_CODE <- substr(predictors$EA_CODE, 1, 5)
data$TA_CODE <- substr(data$EA_CODE, 1, 5)
ebp <- ebp(fixed = ebpformula, # the formula
  pop_data = predictors, # the population data
  pop_domains = "TA_CODE", # the domain (area) name in the population data
  smp_data = data, # the sample data
  smp_domains = "TA_CODE", # the domain (area) name in the sample data
  transformation = "arcsin", # I'm going to use the arcsin transformation
  weights = "total_weights", # sample weights
  weights_type = "nlme", # weights type
  MSE = TRUE, # variance? yes please
  L = 0) # this is a new thing in povmap: "analytical" variance estimates. much faster!
head(ebp$ind)
```
